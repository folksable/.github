### Why I'm Building Folksable?

Social media by its design, has changed an entire generation's perception of reality with its ever-increasing unrealistic standards, incentivizing people not to showcase their growth, but only the absolute successful outcomes.

Itâ€™s making people think theyâ€™re in a spotlight, and their every move needs to be perfect, picking a new skill or working towards a new career path means we are not going to be as good in the beginning, itâ€™s become very discouraging to be mediocre, but thatâ€™s the thing, everyone that has become great has to have been mediocre at one point before they were great, and this causes people to tell themselves they are never going to be as good as someone they see as great on their screens.

It feels like an entire generation has been robbed of their space to grow and make mistakes, causing people to think that skills and abilities come innately for many, and so they forget [greatness](https://about.folksable.com/greatness) as a quality that comes with repetition & continuous improvement, because no one is sharing their growth in public.

Folksable is an honest attempt at reminding and inspiring people of [greatness](https://about.folksable.com/greatness) as a quality instead of an absolute outcome.

Watch this [clip from Ed Sheeran](https://youtu.be/flkjMuaKYQU?t=35) an early recording of himself when he was younger trying to sing, even the greatest artists we know need their space to grow into their artistic abilities and tastes with practice. 

> Imitation comes before creativity, most creatives would agree.

On Folksable, there's a good chance that a friend of yours has a keen interest in playing guitar and has a ritual of it on the app and shares their progress, this may be surprising for you to learn about them because they'd probably not show that on other social apps and only share once they feel they're good at it.

I put a great deal of thought into building the product to avoid the negatives of social media that our generation has been through, as much 

### Productivity of Our Generation

Many of the traditional productivity apps like calendar or planner apps arenâ€™t speaking to the younger generation (genz), as many of them don't know how to use a digital calendar, or what a bcc or cc in an email is,  A full-fledged project management app would be overkill for most everyday activities.

Every generation has a chance to either live with the tools and the ways of doing things that previous generations had built and pioneered or could reinvent for themselves.

That's why, I'm building folksable to help our generation get stuff done in their style as they grew up in social apps sharing pictures with friends.

As much as criticism the younger generation gets for their "Goldfish Attention Spans" and being a "Snowflake", we are also a generation that wants to be healthier than before, we are more aware of the negatives of excessive technology use, and more self-aware about mental health, in one sentence we made it cool to be healthy again.
